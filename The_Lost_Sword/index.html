                    You live in a small village, where once everything was happiness and joy.
                    Until as the legend said, an evil wizard came and took control of the minds
                    of all people, you are the only one who escaped the spell and you know the
                    legend. "The only one with a clear mind will be the carrier of Lightbringer
                    the magic sword…" so you need to go and search the sword that will defeat
                    the wizard and release your people.

                    You try to remember what the legend says about the location of the sword,
                    but you only remember a few words. "The fairy will guide the path" so, which
                    way will you take, the left to the Dark Forest or the right to the Enchanted
                    ruins?

                    Now you are in the dark forest, you can barely see, is misty and the floor
                    it's muddy. Suddenly a fairy appears and she tells you to follow her. But she
                    flies so fast that you can't follow, you continue to walk until the path
                    forks, and there is a sign "West: Forgotten Swamps, East: Mountains of fire".
                </p>

                    Now you are in the enchanted ruins, you can hear whispers everywhere but you
                    can't see anybody; maybe the fairies. Behind a wall you hear a voice that
                    tells you choose right... right... but you keep walking until you arrive to
                    a dead end, you decide to turn back but everything looks different you feel
                    lost, at the end of the corridor you can see two doors one beside the other
                    and each one have a legend the right door you can read "Endless Plains" in
                    the left one "River of Desires" which way you will go?

                    You arrive to the forgotten swamps, smells like rotten eggs, you see a couple
                    of crocodiles; you need to be cautious here. Walking in the swamps the water
                    reaches your knees. Suddenly you feel that something pull your ankle you fall
                    down and a rock hit your head. Your head bleed but you feel right to continue,
                    now you realise that you can remember the final part of legend "...the
                    Lightbringer sleeps in an ancient place with the dead lords" When you get the
                    end of the swamps you will go to Castle Black or to the Temple of the Seven?

                    When you arrive to the mountains of fire instantly you feel the heat of the
                    lava, you can detect the sulfur in the air is hard to breath. It's a
                    difficult path; out of the blue a lava explosion, sends you down and a big
                    rock hits your head, it all turned black. When you wake up your realize that
                    you passed out. For some reason know you can remember the the last part of
                    the legend "...the Lightbringer sleeps in an ancient place with the dead
                    lords" you need to decide now if you will take the "Lava path" or go through
                    the mountain to the "Dwarven Mines"?

                    tall trees and beautiful flowers everywhere. In your path you see something
                    moving in the river, curiously you go to se what it is and a beautiful siren
                    appears she asks you to follow her into the river, she said she has something
                    for you. You will go with her or you will keep walking on your own?
